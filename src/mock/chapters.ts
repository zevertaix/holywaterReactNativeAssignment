  "The red and purple lights danced and flashed around me, highlighting the bodies of the exotic dancers on the stage. Strippers in expensive lingerie and perfume walked around serving drinks or looking for potential customers.\n\
    The dark teal booths were half-full, some with just men and women enjoying the show, whilst others enjoyed a lap dance. A few men in suits are being escorted away by dancers to the private rooms.\n\
    Kingdom of Sin is a human strip club in the heart of one of the busiest cities in the country, a place quite far away from my home, and the chance of running into someone I knew was unlikely. Not to mention I have used a scent disguise twice. It's a formula that would make me smell like a human to other werewolves.\n\
    I didnвЂ™t want Judah to find me here.\n\
    The fact that he may have been on our Pack territory made my stomach twist, although I kept telling myself he had just guessed what I was wearing.\n\
    I needed a break from my mind and those messages. The entire day I had been unable to focus on anything. To make matters worse, tonight is the Blood Moon, an occurrence that only happens twice a year. A night where unmated wolves would head to one of the Blood Moon Gatherings to see if they could scout their fated mates.\n\
    I didnвЂ™t want to go, I'm done with men, and I donвЂ™t want to be tied down to anyone. After going through a relationship that was a complete failure, I had no expectations of finding my true mate, nor do I think I was mentally up for it.\n\
    Even though I did want to find my mate, and deep down I want that love that I see those around me have, IвЂ™m not sure he will want me. I donвЂ™t need my heart breaking again. Although I wouldnвЂ™t admit it, IвЂ™m a little afraid of what he will think of me, how he might hate me when he learns about my past. About the skeletons in my closet, will my mate accept everything about me? Or will he simply despise me, or worse, reject me?\n\
    The tasteful music relaxes me a lot. IвЂ™m tapping my foot to the beat as I sit in a booth, staring at the dancers on the stage. Her body sways sensually to the beat.\n\
    I down my glass of whisky, wishing there was something stronger here. The liquid burns my throat, my eyes stinging a little as my mind returns to the messages.\n\
    The strict no-phone policy was enforced in this club and if I had my phone with me, I knew I would be staring at it constantly thinking about the messages.",

  "I needed a break from it вЂ“ from him.\n\
    Nothing scares me, nothing rocks me, but something about him got to me.\n\
    I pour myself another glass as a gorgeous brunette comes over, ready to entertain me, but IвЂ™m not in the mood.\n\
    вЂњNo thanks.вЂќ I flash the gorgeous brunette a grin and wink.\n\
    I glanced around, observing that most of those in this club were affluent businessmen. Grabbing my glass, I gulp it down.\n\
    I close my eyes for a second, before refilling my glass once more.\n\
    My mind is a storm of emotions.\n\
    Judah had too much on me; things he is now using to blackmail me with. I know I can just tell someone, and we could deal with this, but all my life I have just caused problems for everyone.\n\
    There is something about him that just isnвЂ™t normal, something that tells me he is more than just a werewolfвЂ¦\n\
    I have drunk a lot, emptying the last drops of my fourth bottle into my glass. IвЂ™m beginning to feel it taking a little effect. This is what I neededвЂ¦ I close my eyes, letting the music envelope my senses.\n\
    Tonight, I just want a break, IвЂ™ll deal with the messages another dayвЂ¦\n\
    I open my eyes, looking through my thick lashes at the women on stage. I love dancing, and something about pole dancing just feels empowering and exhilarating. If done right, it truly is an art. I applied for a job just over a year ago at a club near home, and I got it too, but I only managed to do one session because my brother found outвЂ¦\n\
    I shudder remembering the rage in LiamвЂ™s eyes when he stormed into the club and saw the men with their eyes on me. Although I usually have him wrapped around my finger, on the rare occasions when he did get angry... well let's just say, yeah. No. Big no.\n\
    Do not get Liam angry.\n\
    I preferred him to stick to being an oversized dense puppy.\n\
    But heвЂ™s still my favorite.\n\
    Maybe I should go dancing.\n\
    I stood up, making my way over to the dance floor, which was off through a pair of double doors, running my fingers through my hair, when I froze. A familiar dangerous smell hits me, and my heart thuds.\n\
    HeвЂ™s here.\n\
    Fear that I rarely felt envelops me, and I scan the area, wishing I hadn't worn such high heels, wanting to blend in.\n\
    Keeping my head low, I pray that the scent disguiser works, I need to get out of here. I saw the hooded man by the entrance, and a shiver ran down my spine.\n\
    It is him.\n\
    He seems to be searching for something or someone.\n\
    Me.\n\
    Spotting a pair of doors leading to the VIP area open, a woman in a tiny skirt and revealing blouse steps out with a keycard in her hand, and it gives me an idea.\n\
    She struts to the bar and I head towards her, accidentally jumping into her. I mumble an apology as I swipe the card from her pocket.\n\
    My heart is pounding, the fear that he will find me makes me sick.\n\
    Why canвЂ™t he just let me go?\n\
    I scan the card, take a discreet glance around, and slip through the doors that click open. I just needed a place to wait around until he left. If he had entered our pack, then he must have known that my bike it outside.\n\
    вЂњDid you hear that?вЂќ\n\
    I froze.",

  "Werewolves? I could smell them. What on earth was going on? This was a human club, right?\n\
    вЂњI donвЂ™t recognize that scent, did someone sneak in?вЂќ\n\
    Oh no.\n\
    I look around, frowning. Three corridors lead off from here. Silently I hurry down the left one and up the flight of steps, thanking the goddess for the carpeted halls to muffle my footsteps.\n\
    To my relief, I see a pair of glass doors that are standing open. I rush inside, closing them behind me and letting out a breath of relief.\n\
    IвЂ™m in a large room that looks down upon the club, from here I can see everything. I was sure from down below this was just part of the mirrored design of the ceiling, they couldnвЂ™t see me.\n\
    I look around the room, the floor is a glittering black marble, with two blue velvet sofas and a glass table at the center. A bar with drinks stands to the side, but no matter where you look, this room gives us the perfect view of the dance show below, without the smell of sweat or arousal hanging in the air.\n\
    Should I wait around here? What should I do?\n\
    Goddess, what have I gotten myself into?\n\
    My phone is in the locker too, I canвЂ™t even contact someone.\n\
    Suddenly the sound of footsteps and talking reaches my ears, they are approaching fast. I glance around, my attention falling to the bar, and my heart thumps as I quickly hide underneath it.\n\
    I peep out from the side, spotting several men coming closer. Two men get to the door first, holding them open for the rest. My heart sinks when I realize there are a few werewolves present as well.\n\
    They are going to sniff me out!",

  "Each man meant business, from their suits and their dangerous appearances, but it was the one in the center that stood out. Pulling my attention to him entirely.\n\
  Not only is he an Alpha, but the power and dominance that rolls off him is so intense I almost forget to breathe.\n\
  Everyone else seems to fade away as I stare at the man in the middle. HeвЂ™s wearing a fitted black shirt, his sleeves rolled up with black pants and boots. He holds his jacket over his shoulder on one finger and despite the darkness in the club, he wears a pair of shades. His chocolate-colored hair is short and styled back. From what I can tell his entire neck, his arms, and his hands are covered in tattoos.\n\
  And then my heart lurches when the most intoxicating scent hits me; woody and dangerous, with the hint of blood mandarin, warm cinnamon, and patchouli. And the scent is coming from none other than the Alpha male in the center.\n\
  He pauses, tensing as he turns his head slightly.\n\
  He has smelt me.\n\
  The restlessness of my wolf and the pounding of my heart is no longer in my control. Every cell in my body is going haywire as I stare at none other than the god before me.\n\
  HeвЂ™s my mate.",
